# Split-VAE
Beta-VAE with split latent space

Run Beta_VAE.ipynb to train a Normal Beta-VAE.
Run Split_Latent_Space_Beta_VAE.ipynb to train a SplitVAE.
Run Run_tensorboard.ipynb to view saved data on Tensorboard.
Run get_reconstructions.ipynb to get reconstructions by loading both BetaVAE and SplitVAE using checkpoint data.

Google Colab was used in the project and hence the notebooks are coded to be used with Colab.
The notebooks are easy to understand and the parameters for the runs are changed through the "parameters" variable.

This code is adapted from https://github.com/1Konny/Beta-VAE. Refer that repository for doubts on setting up environment or downloading datasets.
